Hi there! I'm a PhD student in the Department of Government at [The University of Texas at Austin](https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/government/) and a Research Fellow with [Innovations for Peace and Development](http://www.ipdutexas.org/). My research interests are mainly in (international) political economy; I am particularly interested in studying the evolving role that private industry plays in economic and social development, and the evolving relationship between multinational enterprises and the nation-state. I received a BA in Political Science from [Temple University](https://www.temple.edu/) in 2017.
