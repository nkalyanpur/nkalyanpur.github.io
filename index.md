Hello, and thanks for visiting my page! I am a PhD student in the Department of Government at [The University of Texas at Austin](https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/government/), where I am also a Clyde Rabb Littlefield Distinguished Graduate fellow for the 2020-2021 academic year. I study the politics of business, primarily at the international level; I am particularly interested in the regulation of multinational enterprises, the political economy of firm-level trade and investment, and international economic law. Some of my work has been accepted for publication in *International Organization* and *The Review of International Organizations*. I received a BA in Political Science from [Temple University](https://www.temple.edu/) in 2017. 

You can find my CV (last updated January 2021) [here](assets/Thrall_CV_Jan_2021.pdf).
