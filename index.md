Hello! I am an Assistant Professor at the [Internanional Relations Department of the London School of Economics](https://www.lse.ac.uk/international-relations). I research topics at the intersection of business-government relations, extraterritorial governance, and economic statecraft. 

I received a PhD in [Government from Georgetown University](https://government.georgetown.edu/#) and was a postdoctoral fellow at Princeton University's [Niehaus Center for Globalization and Governance](https://niehaus.princeton.edu/) for the 2020-2021 academic year. Before graduate school, I studied Philosophy, Politics, and Economics at Brown University and worked as a Research Associate at Harvard Business School. 

I spend a disproportionate amount of my time reading and thinking about Manchester United, often bemoaning our need for a defensive midfielder.

You can find my CV [here]().
