Hi there! I'm a PhD student in the Department of Government at [The University of Texas at Austin](https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/government/) and a Research Fellow with [Innovations for Peace and Development](http://www.ipdutexas.org/). My research interests are mainly in international political economy; I am particularly interested in the impact of cross-border financial flows on domestic political institutions. I received a BA in Political Science from [Temple University](https://www.temple.edu/) in 2017.
